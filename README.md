PEPPINO VS FOOTSIES

Some kind of 2D fighter made with SDL2 libraries, featuring Peppino from Pizza Tower and the main character of FOOTSIES as (hopefully) playable characters.

Peppino sprites taken from the hit indie game [Pizza Tower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/) made by [Tour de Pizza](https://x.com/PizzaTowergame), currently also residing on 
[The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/pizzatower/sheet/133492/), ripped from the game by DogToon64 and Random Talking Bush.

FOOTSIES Guy sprites taken from the github page for the [free-to-play](https://github.com/hifight/Footsies/tree/master) version of [FOOTSIES](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1344740/FOOTSIES_Rollback_Edition/), 
another indie game that showcases the fundamentals of playing 2D fighters (ones that are better constructed than this one, at least), made by the 
great fighting game clip showcaser [Hi-Fight](https://x.com/HiFightTH).
Both games are available on their respective Steam pages.
